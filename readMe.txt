:to understand the js part

The SpeechSynthesisUtterance interface of the Web Speech API represents a speech request. It contains the content the speech service
should read and information about how to read it (e.g. language, pitch and volume.) 

The Web Speech API enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech),
and SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.)

let speech = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance();: This line creates a new instance of the SpeechSynthesisUtterance object, which represents
a speech request. It contains properties for controlling the pitch, rate, volume, and other aspects of the speech.

let voices = [];: This line declares an empty array named voices which will store the available voices for speech synthesis.

let voiceSelect = document.querySelector("select");: This line selects the <select> element in the HTML document. 
This <select> element is a dropdown menu where users can select different voices. 
eg. if i select google deutsch then the value of voiceSelect will be google deutsch

window.speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged = () => { ... }: This line sets up an event listener that listens for changes
in the available voices. When the voices change, the function inside the callback will be executed.

voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();: Inside the event listener, this line retrieves the available voices using 
window.speechSynthesis.getVoices() and assigns them to the voices array

speech.voice = voices[0];: This line sets the voice property of the speech object to the first voice in the voices array.
By default, it selects the first voice available.

speech.rate  it's value can be from 0 to 10. it sets the speed of the speech

//voices.forEach((voice, i) => (voiceSelect.options[i] = new Option(voice.name, i)));: This line iterates over the voices 
array and dynamically creates <option> elements for each voice in the dropdown menu (<select> element). Each <option> element
corresponds to a voice, and its value attribute is set to the index of the voice in the voices array.
..it deals with dynamically populating the dropdown menu (<select> element) with options representing the available voices for speech 
synthesis.
This line utilizes the forEach() method to iterate over each voice in the voices array. For each voice, it executes a function that does
the following:

Creates a new Option object representing a choice in the dropdown menu.
Assigns this Option object to the options property of the <select> element (voiceSelect).
Sets the text property of the Option object to the name of the voice (voice.name), which will be displayed to the user in the dropdown menu.
Sets the value property of the Option object to the index of the voice in the voices array (i). This allows us to identify which voice the user
has selected when handling events later.
So, essentially, this line dynamically creates <option> elements for each voice in the voices array and adds them to the dropdown menu, 
allowing the user to select from the available voices for speech synthesis. Each option's text is set to the voice's name, and its value is
set to the index of the voice in the voices array. //

voiceSelect.addEventListener("change", () => { ... });: This line adds an event listener to the <select> element. It listens for a change event, 
meaning when the user selects a different voice from the dropdown menu.

speech.voice = voices[voiceSelect.value];: Inside the event listener for the change event, this line sets the voice property of the speech object to 
the selected voice from the dropdown menu. It uses the value attribute of the <select> element to retrieve the index of the selected voice from the
voices array.

document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", () => { ... });: This line adds an event listener to the button element. It listens for 
a click event, indicating that the user has clicked the button to trigger the text-to-speech conversion.

speech.text = document.querySelector("textarea").value;: Inside the event listener for the click event, this line sets the text property
of the speech object to the value entered in the textarea element. The textarea element is where the user inputs the text they want to
convert to speech.

window.speechSynthesis.speak(speech);: Finally, this line initiates the speech synthesis by calling the speak() method
of the window.speechSynthesis object and passing the speech object as an argument. This will cause the browser to speak the text 
specified in the speech object using the selected voice and other settings.
